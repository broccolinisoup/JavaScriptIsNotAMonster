# JavaScriptIsNotAMonster

This repository includes code examples and explanations that I briefly took during my JS learning process.

Examples are coming from Tony Alicea which gives this awesome course on udemy.

What did I wrap up? 

Code samples and their explanations to show how JS works, what makes JS different from the others and why JS is not a monster

Hope you enjoy as much as me!
